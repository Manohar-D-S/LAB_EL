#Backend

-When the resultant route is Cached, it is not in the response format, either it has to be stored in the proper format, or has to be transformed before sending it to the frontend
-Traffic function to the route calculation

#Frontend

-In the simulationBar, the distance is not updated when it starts

-Once the route is received and has been displayed, the further clicks are being counted for the dynamic points resulting in re-sending a new unintended request to the backend
