follow the below instructions

open 2 terminals in this main project folder (where the readme.md file is placed)

TERMINAL 1:
    cd server
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python main.py

TERMINAL 2:
    cd web
    npm install         
    npm run dev


DEBUGGING:
    Check the server_logs.log file for server side debugging
    When running the web app in a browser, check inspect for api call logs
    Some browser might not work well in the first run, so preferably use firefox
